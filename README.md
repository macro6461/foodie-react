# foodie-react

This is the source code for the upcoming `foodie-react` NPM package: a package that React developers can use to insert an instant restaurant search pane in their app.

A few years ago, I was working with someone who said, "I want you to be able to order Pizza from our app". That encouraged me to come up with [`foodie`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/foodie), the command line interface one can use to find restuarants nearby.

Here we are years later, and I am inspired to bring that logic into a genuine user interface. No matter what your React app does, with `foodie-react`, your React app will definitely be able to order pizza-or any cuisine for that matter!
